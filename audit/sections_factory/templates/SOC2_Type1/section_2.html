The description is intended to provide report users with information about the {{ client }} System that may be useful when assessing the risks arising from interactions with the {{ client }} System, particularly information about system controls that {{ client }} has designed, implemented and operated to provide reasonable assurance that its service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the trust services criteria relevant to {{ TSCs }} (applicable trust services criteria) set forth in TSP Section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria).</span></p>

    <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We have examined {{ client }}&rsquo;s accompanying description of its {{system_name}} found in Section 3 titled &ldquo;{{ client }}&rsquo;s Description of its {{system_name}} for the period {{ review_period }}&rdquo; (description), based on the criteria for a description of a service organization&rsquo;s system set forth in DC Section 200, 2018 Description Criteria for a Description of a Service Organization&rsquo;s System in a SOC 2&reg; Report (AICPA, Description Criteria), (description criteria) and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls stated in the description for the period {{ review_period }}, to provide reasonable assurance that {{ client }}&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the trust services criteria relevant to {{ TSCs }} (applicable trust services criteria) set forth in TSP Section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria).</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The description indicates that certain complementary user entity controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively are necessary, along with controls at {{ client }}, to achieve {{ client }}&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria. The description presents {{ client }}&rsquo;s controls, the applicable trust services criteria, and the complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of {{ client }}&rsquo;s controls. Our examination did not include such complementary user entity controls and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such controls.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">{{ client }} uses a subservice organization for data center colocation services. The description indicates that complementary subservice organization controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively are necessary, along with controls at {{ client }} to achieve {{ client }}&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria. The description presents {{ client }}&rsquo;s controls, the applicable trust services criteria, and the types of complementary subservice organization controls assumed in the design of {{ client }}&rsquo;s controls. The description does not disclose the actual controls at the subservice organization. Our examination did not include the services provided by the subservice organization, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary subservice organization controls.</span></p>

    {% if has_section_v %}
    <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The information included in Section 5, &ldquo;Other Information Provided by {{client}} that is not Covered by the Service Auditor&rsquo;s Report&rdquo;, is presented by {{client}} management to provide additional information and is not part of the description. Information about {{client}}&lsquo;s responses to exceptions noted has not been subjected to the procedures applied in the examination of the description, the suitability of the design of controls, and the operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve {{client}}&lsquo;s service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria.</span></p>
    {% endif %}

    <p><strong>Service Organization&rsquo;s Responsibilities</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">{{ client }} is responsible for its service commitments and system requirements and for designing, implementing, and operating effective controls within the system to provide reasonable assurance that {{ client }}&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements were achieved. In Section 2, {{ client }} has provided the accompanying assertion titled &ldquo;Assertion of {% if company_legal_name %}{{ company_legal_name }}{% else %}<span style="background: yellow;">Company Legal Name</span>{% endif %}&rsquo;s Management&rdquo; (assertion) about the description and the suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls stated therein. {{ client }} is also responsible for preparing the description and assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the description and assertion; providing the services covered by the description; selecting the applicable trust services criteria and stating the related controls in the description; and identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the service organization&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Service Auditor&rsquo;s Responsibilities</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the description and on the suitability of design of controls stated in the description based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the description is presented in accordance with the description criteria and the controls stated therein were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">An examination of a description of a service organization&rsquo;s system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls involves&mdash;</span></p>

    <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
            <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Obtaining an understanding of the system and the service organization&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements.</span>

    <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Our examination also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Inherent Limitations</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">The description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of report users and may not, therefore, include every aspect of the system that individual report users may consider important to meet their informational needs. There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of controls. Because of their nature, controls may not always operate effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization&rsquo;s service commitments and system requirements are achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. Also, the projection to the future of any conclusions about the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of controls is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Description of Tests of Controls</strong></p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">The specific controls we tested and the nature, timing, and results of those tests are listed in Section 4, &ldquo;Description of Criteria, {{client}}&rsquo;s Controls, Service Auditor Tests, and Results of Tests&rdquo; of this report.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Because the {% if not_tested_controls|length > 1 %} controls {% else %} control {% endif %} described above {% if not_tested_controls|length > 1 %} were {% else %} was {% endif %} not required to operate during the period, we did not test the operating effectiveness of {% if not_tested_controls|length > 1 %} those {% else %} that {% endif %} {% if not_tested_controls|length > 1 %} controls {% else %} control {% endif %} as evaluated using the following trust services criteria (TSC):</span></p>
